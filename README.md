# How to run
*Make sure you have node installed before you run the server.*

Install node packages:
```
npm install
```

Run server:
```
node server.js
```

Access `localhost:8080` in your browser.

# Important
You have to add at least one sound into the /sounds folder (only mp3/ogg). Then, edit the `const sounds = [];` within the main.js file. Press space to play or pause or the arrow keys left and right to choose next/previous sound.
